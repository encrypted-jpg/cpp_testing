# CPP TESTING

#### Testing CPP Files with multiple Test Cases at Once

###### Requirements
* Python Requirements are in requirements.txt file.
* To Run CPP Files cpp (g++) compiler is needed.

###### How to Use
* To Get Started Upload a CPP File.
    * To use the previously uploaded file instead of uploading again, you can just check the "Use the previous file" Checkbox.
* To Test the Code
    * For testing code with manually given test cases, enter the input and expected output for each test case in the corresponding textbox.
        * To Add Test Case click on the "Add Test Case" button to get a new row.
    * Instead of entering the test cases manually, you can get the test cases directly from the "CODE FORCES" site by entering the valid URL of that corresponding problem.
        * To test the code with the test cases from the site only, you need to reset the table every time you test the code, otherwise you will see repetitions.
    * For testing code both with manually given test cases and from the "CODE FORCES" site, you need to enter the input and expected output for each test case in the corresponding textbox and the Valid URL of the corresponding problem.
* Compilation Errors and Invalid URL Errors will be displayed if exists after clicking "Test Code" button.
* When viewing the Results of testing, to view the tested code, click on "Selected File" button.
